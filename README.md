## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in the Seattle AirBnB homes data to better understand:

1.How does price varies for the listings based on the locality?Â¶

2.Which time/month of the year are best in term of price ?

3.How to arrive at pricing for the new listings?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  This notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells wre used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).
